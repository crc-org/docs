== DNS configuration details

=== General DNS setup

The {ocp} cluster managed by {prod} uses 2 DNS domain names, `crc.testing` and `apps-crc.testing`.
The `crc.testing` domain is for core {ocp} services.
The `apps-crc.testing` domain is for accessing {openshift} applications deployed on the cluster.

For example, the {ocp} API server is exposed as `api.crc.testing` while the {ocp} console is accessed as `console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing`.
These DNS domains are served by a `dnsmasq` DNS container running inside the {prod} instance.

The [command]`{bin} setup` command detects and adjusts your system DNS configuration so that it can resolve these domains.
Additional checks are done to verify DNS is properly configured when running [command]`{bin} start`.

=== DNS on Linux

On Linux, depending on your distribution, {prod} expects the following DNS configuration:

==== NetworkManager + systemd-resolved

This configuration is used by default on Fedora 33 or newer, and on Ubuntu Desktop editions.

* {prod} expects NetworkManager to manage networking.
* {prod} configures `systemd-resolved` to forward requests for the `testing` domain to the `192.168.130.11` DNS server.
`192.168.130.11` is the IP of the {prod} instance.
* `systemd-resolved` configuration is done with a NetworkManager dispatcher script in [filename]*_/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-crc.sh_*:
+
----
#!/bin/sh

export LC_ALL=C

systemd-resolve --interface crc --set-dns 192.168.130.11 --set-domain ~testing

exit 0
----

[NOTE]
====
`systemd-resolved` is also available as an unsupported Technology Preview on {rhel} and {centos} 8.3.
After {rhel-resolved-docs}[configuring the host] to use `systemd-resolved`, stop any running clusters and rerun [command]`{bin} setup`.
====

==== NetworkManager + dnsmasq

This configuration is used by default on Fedora 32 or older, on {rhel}, and on {centos}.

* {prod} expects NetworkManager to manage networking.
* NetworkManager uses `dnsmasq` with the [filename]*_/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/crc-nm-dnsmasq.conf_* configuration file.
* The configuration file for this `dnsmasq` instance is [filename]*_/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf_*:
+
----
server=/crc.testing/192.168.130.11
server=/apps-crc.testing/192.168.130.11
----

** The NetworkManager `dnsmasq` instance forwards requests for the `crc.testing` and `apps-crc.testing` domains to the `192.168.130.11` DNS server.

== Reserved IP subnets

The {ocp} cluster managed by {prod} reserves IP subnets for internal use, which should not collide with your host network.
Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use:

.Reserved IP subnets
* `10.217.0.0/22`
* `10.217.4.0/23`
* `192.168.126.0/24`

Additionally, the host hypervisor might reserve another IP subnet depending on the host operating system.
No additional subnet is reserved on {mac} and {msw}.
The additional reserved subnet for Linux is `192.168.130.0/24`.

== Starting {prod} behind a proxy

You can start {prod} behind a defined proxy using environment variables or configurable properties.

[NOTE]
====
SOCKS proxies are not supported by {ocp}.
====

.Prerequisites
* If you are not using [command]`crc oc-env`, when interacting with the cluster, export the `.testing` domain as part of the `no_proxy` environment variable.
The embedded [command]`oc` executable does not require manual settings.
For more information about using the embedded [command]`oc` executable, see xref:using.adoc#accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-the-openshift-cli[Accessing the {openshift} cluster with the {openshift} CLI].

.Procedure
. Define a proxy using the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables or using the [command]`{bin} config set` command as follows:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set http-proxy http://proxy.example.com:__<port>__
$ {bin} config set https-proxy http://proxy.example.com:__<port>__
$ {bin} config set no-proxy __<comma-separated-no-proxy-entries>__
----

. If the proxy uses a custom CA certificate file, set it as follows:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set proxy-ca-file __<path-to-custom-ca-file>__
----

[NOTE]
====
Proxy-related values set in the configuration for {prod} have priority over values set with environment variables.
====

== Accessing services running on your host from {prod}

When you run services on your host, you can configure {prod} to access these services.

.Prerequisites
* You have a service which is running on your host and want to consume it with {prod}.
* You are using the user mode network. On {mac} and {msw} this is the default behavior.


.Procedure
. Enable accessing services from host to {prod}:
+
----
$ crc config set host-network-access true
----

. Verify that the {prod} configuration uses user network mode and enables host network access:
+
----
$ crc config view
[...]
- network-mode                          : user
- host-network-access                   : true
[...]
----

. If {prod} instance is already running then restart it (stop => start), otherwise just start it.
+
----
$ crc stop && crc start
----

.Verification
Assuming your service is running on the host on port `8080`, to access
it from the {prod} instance, use `host.crc.testing:8080`.

== Setting up {prod} on a remote server

Configure a remote server to run an {ocp} cluster provided by {prod}.

This procedure assumes the use of a {rhel}, {fed}, or {centos} server.
Run every command in this procedure on the remote server.

[NOTE]
====
These instructions will only work for system-mode networking.
====

[WARNING]
====
**Perform this procedure only on a local network.**
Exposing an insecure server on the internet has many security implications.
====

.Prerequisites
* {prod} is installed and set up on the remote server.
For more information, see xref:installing.adoc[Installing {prod}] and xref:using.adoc#setting-up[Setting up {prod}].
* {prod} is configured to use the {openshift} preset on the remote server.
For more information, see xref:configuring.adoc#changing-the-selected-preset[Changing the selected preset].
* {prod} is configured to use system-mode networking.
* Your user account has `sudo` permissions on the remote server.

.Procedure
. Start the cluster:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----
+
Ensure that the cluster remains running during this procedure.

. Install the [package]`haproxy` package and other utilities:
+
----
$ sudo dnf install haproxy /usr/sbin/semanage
----

. Modify the firewall to allow communication with the cluster:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=kube-apiserver --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

. For SELinux, allow HAProxy to listen on TCP port 6443 to serve `kube-apiserver` on this port:
+
----
$ sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 6443
----

. Create a backup of the default [application]`haproxy` configuration:
+
----
$ sudo cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.bak}
----

. Configure [application]`haproxy` for use with the cluster:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ export CRC_IP=$({bin} ip)
$ sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg &>/dev/null <<EOF
global
    log /dev/log local0

    log global
    maxconn 100
    mode tcp
    timeout connect 5s
    timeout client 500s
    timeout server 500s

listen apps
    bind 0.0.0.0:80
    server crcvm $CRC_IP:80 check

listen apps_ssl
    bind 0.0.0.0:443
    server crcvm $CRC_IP:443 check

listen api
    bind 0.0.0.0:6443
    server crcvm $CRC_IP:6443 check
EOF
----

. Start the [application]`haproxy` service:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl start haproxy
----

== Connecting to a remote {prod} instance

Use [application]`dnsmasq` to connect a client machine to a remote server running an {ocp} cluster managed by {prod}.

This procedure assumes the use of a {rhel}, {fed}, or {centos} client.
Run every command in this procedure on the client.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Connect to a server that is only exposed on your local network.**
====

.Prerequisites
* A remote server is set up for the client to connect to.
For more information, see xref:setting-up-on-a-remote-server[Setting up {prod} on a remote server].
* You know the external IP address of the server.
* You have the link:{oc-download-url}[latest {openshift} CLI ([command]`oc`)] in your `$PATH` on the client.

.Procedure
. Install the [package]`dnsmasq` package:
+
----
$ sudo dnf install dnsmasq
----

. Enable the use of [application]`dnsmasq` for DNS resolution in NetworkManager:
+
----
$ sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/use-dnsmasq.conf &>/dev/null <<EOF
[main]
dns=dnsmasq
EOF
----

. Add DNS entries for {prod} to the [application]`dnsmasq` configuration:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/external-crc.conf &>/dev/null <<EOF
address=/apps-crc.testing/__SERVER_IP_ADDRESS__
address=/api.crc.testing/__SERVER_IP_ADDRESS__
EOF
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Comment out any existing entries in [filename]*_/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf_*.
These entries are created by running a local instance of {prod} and will conflict with the entries for the remote cluster.
====

. Reload the NetworkManager service:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl reload NetworkManager
----

. Log in to the remote cluster as the `developer` user with [command]`oc`:
+
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
----
+
The remote {ocp} web console is available at \https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing.
