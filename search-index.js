This guide will help you get started with CodeReady Containers (CRC) in OpenShift. CRC provides a way to run OpenShift locally for development and testing purposes. In order to download and install CRC, please refer to the Installation Guide. Ensure you have the minimum hardware and software requirements for CRC. Download the latest CRC release from the official website. Install the CRC binary and add it to your system’s PATH. We will be creating a single-node cluster for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Once you’ve downloaded and installed CRC on your machine, you’re ready to use CRC by creating a cluster. OpenShift is the default cluster type that would be created when no explicit configuration is provided. Set up environment for your cluster Before starting cluster, you need to prepare your machine for creating a Virtual Machine. OpenShift cluster would be started inside that Virtual Machine. In order to do that use crc setup command. Open a terminal with a user account with administrator access (but not logged in as root user) and run: $ crc setup Start your cluster Once you’ve set up environment for your OpenShift cluster, you can go ahead and start it. When you’d start the cluster, you would be asked for pull secret. You need to create a Red Hat account and download this file from the Pull Secret section of the CRC page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. $ crc start Log into your cluster Once you’ve created the cluster, and it’s up and running, you need to log in into your OpenShift cluster. In order to do that, use OpenShift CLI (oc). If you already have OpenShift CLI (oc), you can start using it. If not, you can use Run the crc oc-env command to print the command needed to add the cached oc executable to your $PATH. $ crc oc-env Get the OpenShift CLI (oc) login command using crc console to login as regular user or admin. Copy login command from this CRC command output and paste it into your terminal: $ crc console --credentials Deploy a sample application to your OpenShift cluster We will be deploying a simple Java application using a tool called Eclipse JKube OpenShift Maven Plugin. In order to follow these steps, you would need to have these installed: Java Development Kit Apache Maven Once you’ve installed these dependencies, you can deploy any java application to OpenShift cluster. Clone Eclipse JKube repository and go to one of the quickstarts: $ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-jkube/jkube.git $ cd jkube/quickstarts/maven/quarkus Run JKube OpenShift Maven Plugin goal to build and deploy application to OpenShift cluster: $ mvn package oc:build oc:resource oc:apply Wait till application pod comes in ready state and access the application via route: $ oc get routes $ curl http://quarkus-default.apps-crc.testing We will be creating a single-node cluster for OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution.

For other OpenShift Container Platform use cases, such as headless or multi-developer setups, use the full OpenShift installer. See the OpenShift Container Platform documentation for a full introduction to OpenShift Container Platform. CRC includes the crc command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the CRC instance using the desired container runtime. Red Hat OpenShift Local is the distribution of the crc CLI by Red Hat that includes a fully functional OpenShift Container Platform single node bundle. The OpenShift preset for CRC provides a regular OpenShift Container Platform installation with the following notable differences: The OpenShift Container Platform cluster is ephemeral and is not intended for production use. CRC does not have a supported upgrade path to newer OpenShift Container Platform versions. Upgrading the OpenShift Container Platform version might cause issues that are difficult to reproduce. It uses a single node, which behaves as both a control plane and worker node. It disables the Cluster Monitoring Operator by default. This disabled Operator causes the corresponding part of the web console to be non-functional. It disables the following operators: Cloud Credential Operator. Cluster Autoscaler Operator. Cloud Controller Manager Operator. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs in a virtual machine known as an instance. This might cause other differences, particularly with external networking. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC also includes the following non-customizable cluster settings. These settings should not be modified: The *.crc.testing domain. The address range used for internal cluster communication. The cluster uses the 172 address range. This can cause issues when, for example, a proxy is run in the same address space.","title":"Introducing CRC","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"introducing","url":"/introducing/","titles":[{"text":"About CRC","hash":"about","id":1},{"text":"Differences from a production OpenShift Container Platform installation","hash":"differences","id":2}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"The OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC uses 2 DNS domain names, crc.testing and apps-crc.testing. The crc.testing domain is for core OpenShift Container Platform services. The apps-crc.testing domain is for accessing OpenShift applications deployed on the cluster. For example, the OpenShift Container Platform API server is exposed as api.crc.testing while the OpenShift Container Platform console is accessed as console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing. These DNS domains are served by a dnsmasq DNS container running inside the CRC instance. The crc setup command detects and adjusts your system DNS configuration so that it can resolve these domains. Additional checks are done to verify DNS is properly configured when running crc start. On Linux, depending on your distribution, CRC expects the following DNS configuration: This configuration is used by default on Fedora 33 or newer, and on Ubuntu Desktop editions. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. CRC configures systemd-resolved to forward requests for the testing domain to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. 192.168.130.11 is the IP of the CRC instance. systemd-resolved configuration is done with a NetworkManager dispatcher script in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-crc.sh: #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C systemd-resolve --interface crc --set-dns 192.168.130.11 --set-domain ~testing exit 0 systemd-resolved is also available as an unsupported Technology Preview on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 8.3. After configuring the host to use systemd-resolved, stop any running clusters and rerun crc setup. This configuration is used by default on Fedora 32 or older, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and on CentOS. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. NetworkManager uses dnsmasq with the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/crc-nm-dnsmasq.conf configuration file. The configuration file for this dnsmasq instance is /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf: server=/crc.testing/192.168.130.11 server=/apps-crc.testing/192.168.130.11 The NetworkManager dnsmasq instance forwards requests for the crc.testing and apps-crc.testing domains to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC reserves IP subnets for internal use, which should not collide with your host network. Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use: Reserved IP subnets 10.217.0.0/22 10.217.4.0/23 192.168.126.0/24 Additionally, the host hypervisor might reserve another IP subnet depending on the host operating system. No additional subnet is reserved on macOS and Microsoft Windows. The additional reserved subnet for Linux is 192.168.130.0/24. You can start CRC behind a defined proxy using environment variables or configurable properties. SOCKS proxies are not supported by OpenShift Container Platform. Prerequisites If you are not using crc oc-env, when interacting with the cluster, export the .testing domain as part of the no_proxy environment variable. The embedded oc executable does not require manual settings. For more information about using the embedded oc executable, see Accessing the OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift CLI. Procedure Define a proxy using the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables or using the crc config set command as follows: $ crc config set http-proxy http://proxy.example.com:<port> $ crc config set https-proxy http://proxy.example.com:<port> $ crc config set no-proxy <comma-separated-no-proxy-entries> If the proxy uses a custom CA certificate file, set it as follows: $ crc config set proxy-ca-file <path-to-custom-ca-file> Proxy-related values set in the configuration for CRC have priority over values set with environment variables. When you run services on your host, you can configure CRC to access these services. Prerequisites You have a service which is running on your host and want to consume it with CRC. You are using the user mode network. On macOS and Microsoft Windows this is the default behavior. Procedure Enable accessing services from host to CRC: $ crc config set host-network-access true Verify that the CRC configuration uses user network mode and enables host network access: $ crc config view [...] - network-mode : user - host-network-access : true [...] If CRC instance is already running then restart it (stop ⇒ start), otherwise just start it. $ crc stop && crc start Verification Assuming your service is running on the host on port 8080, to access it from the CRC instance, use host.crc.testing:8080. Configure a remote server to run an OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC. This procedure assumes the use of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or CentOS server. Run every command in this procedure on the remote server. Perform this procedure only on a local network. Exposing an insecure server on the internet has many security implications. Prerequisites CRC is installed and set up on the remote server. For more information, see Installing CRC and Setting up CRC. CRC is configured to use the OpenShift preset on the remote server. For more information, see Changing the selected preset. Your user account has sudo permissions on the remote server. Procedure Start the cluster: $ crc start Ensure that the cluster remains running during this procedure. Install the haproxy package and other utilities: $ sudo dnf install haproxy /usr/sbin/semanage Modify the firewall to allow communication with the cluster: $ sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=kube-apiserver --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload For SELinux, allow HAProxy to listen on TCP port 6443 to serve kube-apiserver on this port: $ sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 6443 Create a backup of the default haproxy configuration: $ sudo cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.bak} Configure haproxy for use with the cluster: $ export CRC_IP=$(crc ip) $ sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg &>/dev/null <<EOF global log /dev/log local0 defaults balance roundrobin log global maxconn 100 mode tcp timeout connect 5s timeout client 500s timeout server 500s listen apps bind 0.0.0.0:80 server crcvm $CRC_IP:80 check listen apps_ssl bind 0.0.0.0:443 server crcvm $CRC_IP:443 check listen api bind 0.0.0.0:6443 server crcvm $CRC_IP:6443 check EOF Start the haproxy service: $ sudo systemctl start haproxy Use dnsmasq to connect a client machine to a remote server running an OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC. This procedure assumes the use of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or CentOS client. Run every command in this procedure on the client. Connect to a server that is only exposed on your local network. Prerequisites A remote server is set up for the client to connect to. For more information, see Setting up CRC on a remote server. You know the external IP address of the server. You have the latest OpenShift CLI (oc) in your $PATH on the client. Procedure Install the dnsmasq package: $ sudo dnf install dnsmasq Enable the use of dnsmasq for DNS resolution in NetworkManager: $ sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/use-dnsmasq.conf &>/dev/null <<EOF [main] dns=dnsmasq EOF Add DNS entries for CRC to the dnsmasq configuration: $ sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/external-crc.conf &>/dev/null <<EOF address=/apps-crc.testing/SERVER_IP_ADDRESS address=/api.crc.testing/SERVER_IP_ADDRESS EOF Comment out any existing entries in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf. These entries are created by running a local instance of CRC and will conflict with the entries for the remote cluster. Reload the NetworkManager service: $ sudo systemctl reload NetworkManager Log in to the remote cluster as the developer user with oc: $ oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443 The remote OpenShift Container Platform web console is available at https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing.","title":"Networking","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"networking","url":"/networking/","titles":[{"text":"DNS configuration details","hash":"_dns_configuration_details","id":1},{"text":"General DNS setup","hash":"_general_dns_setup","id":2},{"text":"DNS on Linux","hash":"_dns_on_linux","id":3},{"text":"NetworkManager + systemd-resolved","hash":"_networkmanager_systemd_resolved","id":4},{"text":"NetworkManager + dnsmasq","hash":"_networkmanager_dnsmasq","id":5},{"text":"Reserved IP subnets","hash":"_reserved_ip_subnets","id":6},{"text":"Starting CRC behind a proxy","hash":"_starting_crc_behind_a_proxy","id":7},{"text":"Accessing services running on your host from CRC","hash":"_accessing_services_running_on_your_host_from_crc","id":8},{"text":"Setting up CRC on a remote server","hash":"setting-up-on-a-remote-server","id":9},{"text":"Connecting to a remote CRC instance","hash":"_connecting_to_a_remote_crc_instance","id":10}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"The goal of CRC is to deliver an OpenShift Container Platform environment for development and testing purposes.

The system bundle of OpenShift Container Platform in each released crc executable expires 1 year after the release. This expiration is due to certificates embedded in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The crc start command triggers an automatic certificate renewal process when needed. Certificate renewal can add up to five minutes to the start time of the cluster. To avoid this additional startup time, or in case of failures in the certificate renewal process, use the following procedure: Procedure To resolve expired certificate errors that cannot be automatically renewed: Download the latest CRC release and place the crc executable in your $PATH. Save any desired information stored in your existing instance. Delete the existing CRC instance. $ crc delete Set up the new release: $ crc setup Start the new instance: $ crc start Created CRC instances contain bundle information and instance data. Bundle information and instance data is not updated when setting up a new CRC release. This information is not updated due to customization in the earlier instance data. This will lead to errors when running the crc start command: $ crc start ... FATA Bundle 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.8.crcbundle' was requested, but the existing VM is using 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.2.crcbundle' Procedure Save any desired information stored in your existing instance. Delete the existing CRC instance. $ crc delete Start a new CRC instance: $ crc start Resolve most issues by restarting CRC with a clean state. This involves stopping the instance, deleting it, reverting changes made by the crc setup command, reapplying those changes, and restarting the instance. Prerequisites You have set up CRC. You have started the CRC instance. You are using the latest CRC release. Using a version earlier than CRC 1.2.0 might result in errors related to expired x509 certificates. For more information, see Troubleshooting expired certificates. Procedure To troubleshoot CRC, perform the following steps: Stop the CRC instance: $ crc stop Save any desired information stored in your existing instance. Delete the existing CRC instance. $ crc delete Clean up remaining changes from the crc setup command: $ crc cleanup The crc cleanup command removes an existing CRC instance and reverts changes to DNS entries created by the crc setup command. Set up your host machine to reapply the changes: $ crc setup Start the CRC instance: $ crc start The cluster takes a minimum of four minutes to start the necessary containers and Operators before serving a request. If your issue is not resolved by this procedure, perform the following steps: Search open issues for the issue that you are encountering. If no existing issue addresses the encountered issue, create an issue and attach the ~/.crc/crc.log file to the created issue. The ~/.crc/crc.log file has detailed debugging and troubleshooting information which can help diagnose the problem that you are experiencing. In case you’re looking for more detailed information about virtual machine startup, state transitions and errors you can look into serial console logs created by virtual machine hypervisors.

Here are various supported presets for CRC along with their minimum system requirements: Preset Name Description CPUs RAM Disk space openshift OpenShift Container Platform 4 10.5 GB 35 GB okd OKD 4 10.5 GB 35 GB microshift MicroShift 2 4 GB 35 GB On Microsoft Windows and macOS, the CRC guided installer prompts you for your desired preset. On Linux, the OpenShift Container Platform preset is selected by default. You can change this selection using the crc config command before running the crc setup command. Only one preset can be active at a time. Let’s take a look into each of these presets in detail: openshift preset creates a minimal, single-node cluster for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. This cluster is very similar to real Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform set up in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, Azure etc. It’s only meant to be used for development and testing purposes. This preset is the default preset used by CRC if not explicit preset is configured. If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this: $ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present) $ crc config set preset openshift # Configure to use openshift preset $ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster $ crc start # Start the cluster OKD preset creates a minimal, single-node cluster for OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution. It is an upstream, community-driven project that provides the core components needed to run Kubernetes. It has similar requirements to the OpenShift Container Platform preset. If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this: $ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present) $ crc config set preset okd # Configure to use okd preset $ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster $ crc start # Start the cluster MicroShift is a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration solution designed by Red Hat. It’s essentially a smaller, more resource-efficient version of Red Hat OpenShift, optimized for edge computing. This preset shouldn’t be confused with OpenShift preset. It is tailored for environments with limited resources. OpenShift on the other hand, is a full-featured platform designed for larger-scale deployments and comprehensive management. For more details, please refer to MicroShift documentation. If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this: $ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present) $ crc config set preset microshift # Configure to use microshift preset $ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster $ crc start # Start the cluster The crc setup command performs operations to set up the environment of your host machine for the CRC instance. The crc setup command creates the ~/.crc directory if it does not already exist. If you are setting up a new version, capture any changes made to the instance before setting up a new CRC release. Prerequisites On Linux or macOS, ensure that your user account has permission to use the sudo command. On Microsoft Windows, ensure that your user account can elevate to Administrator privileges. Do not run the crc executable as the root user or an administrator. Always run the crc executable with your user account. Procedure Set up your host machine for CRC: $ crc setup Additional resources About presets. The crc start command starts the CRC instance and configured container runtime. Prerequisites To avoid networking-related issues, ensure that you are not connected to a VPN and that your network connection is reliable. You have set up CRC. On Microsoft Windows, ensure that your user account can elevate to Administrator privileges. For the OpenShift preset, ensure that you have a valid OpenShift user pull secret. Copy or download the pull secret from the Pull Secret section of the CRC page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. Accessing the user pull secret requires a Red Hat account. Procedure Start the CRC instance: $ crc start For the OpenShift preset, supply your user pull secret when prompted.

Open a terminal with a user account with administrator access (but not logged in as root user) and run: $ crc setup Start your cluster Once you’ve set up environment for your OKD cluster, you can go ahead and start it. $ crc start Log into your OKD cluster Once you’ve created the cluster, and it’s up and running, you need to log in into your OKD cluster. In order to do that, use OKD CLI (oc). If you already have OpenShift CLI (oc), you can start using it. If not, you can use Run the crc oc-env command to print the command needed to add the cached oc executable to your $PATH. $ crc oc-env Get the OpenShift CLI (oc) login command using crc console to login as regular user or admin. Copy login command from this CRC command output and paste it into your terminal: $ crc console --credentials Deploy a sample application to your OKD cluster We will be deploying a simple Java application using a tool called Eclipse JKube OpenShift Maven Plugin. In order to follow these steps, you would need to have these installed: Java Development Kit Apache Maven Once you’ve installed these dependencies, you can deploy any java application to OKD cluster. Clone Eclipse JKube repository and go to one of the quickstarts: $ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-jkube/jkube.git $ cd jkube/quickstarts/maven/quarkus Run JKube OpenShift Maven Plugin goal to build and deploy application to OKD cluster: $ mvn package oc:build oc:resource oc:apply Wait till application pod comes in ready state and access the application via route: $ oc get routes $ curl http://quarkus-default.apps-crc.testing","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"okd","url":"/getting-started-scenarios/okd/","titles":[]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"We will be creating a single-node cluster for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Once you’ve downloaded and installed CRC on your machine, you’re ready to use CRC by creating a cluster. OpenShift is the default cluster type that would be created when no explicit configuration is provided. Set up environment for your cluster Before starting cluster, you need to prepare your machine for creating a Virtual Machine. OpenShift cluster would be started inside that Virtual Machine. In order to do that use crc setup command. Open a terminal with a user account with administrator access (but not logged in as root user) and run: $ crc setup Start your cluster Once you’ve set up environment for your OpenShift cluster, you can go ahead and start it. When you’d start the cluster, you would be asked for pull secret. You need to create a Red Hat account and download this file from the Pull Secret section of the CRC page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. $ crc start Log into your cluster Once you’ve created the cluster, and it’s up and running, you need to log in into your OpenShift cluster.
